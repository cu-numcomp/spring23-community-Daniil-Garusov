# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *NAME_OF_PACKAGE_HERE*
just writting an idea here for now I will do aditional research but the package is polatory

*Write a paragraph describing what the software does and who its
primary audience is.*

it basicaly implements a memory efficient radial basis function for interpolation that can do dual kreiging, which is a technique for estimating values of a function based on spatially correlated data, which takes into account both the observed values of the function and their spatial correlations.

over all:

In other words, it's a computer program that can estimate the value of a function at points between known data points using an RBF, while minimizing the amount of memory it uses. Additionally, this implementation can perform dual kriging, which means it takes into account both the observed values of the function and their spatial correlations when making its estimates.

i'll complete this on saturday morning I promise.
